FreedomPop bot for Telegram
===========================

This bot is intended to be used as a replacement of the FreedomPop app.
It can't do many things yet, but pull requests are welcome.

Unlike many other bots, this one is meant to be run by you, and once it is
running, you're the only one who is supposed to have access to it.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

You need to have Python 3.5 or newer to run it, and you also need to install
the required PyPI packages listed in requirements.txt:

    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Make a copy of config.py.example and call it config.py.

Talk to the @BotFather on Telegram and create a new bot. You'll get a
Telegram token, put it in config.py, along with your FreedomPop user
information.

Once you're done, you need to run the bot to use it:

    $ python3 run.py

Then go to your Telegram client, open a private conversation with the bot
you created, and type /help. You'll get an "access denied" message, along
with your user id. Put your user id in the config file (replacing the user
ids that are there as an example) then restart the bot.


Contributing
------------

This bot is a work in progress, and all contributions are welcome. That said,
to maintain the quality of the code, please make sure all code introduced
passes the PEP8 and pyflakes tests. To check that, install flake8 from PyPI
and run it on the code after you've made the desired changes.

    $ pip3 install flake8
    $ flake8 *.py

A list of problems found in the code will be shown; try to fix them before
you send a pull request.
